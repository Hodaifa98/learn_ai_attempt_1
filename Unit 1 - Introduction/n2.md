# Foundations of AI & Its Core Subfields

## What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and understanding language.

## Subsets of AI

### 1. Machine Learning (ML)
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

### 2. Deep Learning
Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and learn complex patterns in data. It is widely used in fields like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.

### 3. Statistics
Statistics provides the theoretical foundation for machine learning. It involves concepts such as probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlations, and inferential techniques essential for understanding and evaluating models.

### 4. Data Mining
Data mining is the process of extracting useful patterns, relationships, and insights from large datasets. It shares many techniques with machine learning, especially for tasks like clustering and classification.

## Neurons and Neural Networks

### Artificial Neurons
An artificial neuron mimics the structure and function of a biological neuron. It receives inputs, applies a transformation (usually via an activation function), and produces an output.

### Neural Networks
A neural network is a group of interconnected artificial neurons arranged in layers:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts the raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations and pattern detection
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction or classification

Neural networks are fundamental to deep learning and are used in complex pattern recognition tasks.
