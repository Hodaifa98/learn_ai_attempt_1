# General summary

## Unit 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
#### What is AI?
AI is the field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of tasks that typically require human intelligence—like learning, reasoning, language understanding, and decision-making.

#### Types of AI (by capability)

- Narrow AI (ANI): Performs specific tasks (e.g., spam filters, Siri).
- General AI (AGI): Human-like intelligence (still theoretical).
- Superintelligent AI: Beyond human intelligence (hypothetical).

#### Subfields of AI

- Machine Learning (ML): Systems learn from data (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement).
- Deep Learning: Uses neural networks with multiple layers for complex tasks.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding and generating human language.
- Computer Vision: Interpreting visual data.
- Robotics, Search & Optimization, Knowledge Representation, Multi-Agent Systems.

#### Historical Milestones

- 1956: Term “AI” coined at Dartmouth Conference.
- 1970s–80s: Rule-based expert systems.
- 1990s+: Rise of machine learning.
- 2010s–Now: Deep learning, large models (e.g., GPT, AlphaGo).

#### Requirements for AI

- Data: High quality and quantity, labeled or raw depending on approach.
- Computational Power: CPUs for classical AI, GPUs/TPUs for deep learning.
- Algorithms & Models: Evolving from logic to deep learning (e.g., CNNs, Transformers).
- Domain Knowledge: Crucial for practical applications.

#### Applications:

AI is used in healthcare, finance, self-driving cars, virtual assistants, fraud detection, translation, and more.

#### Limitations of AI/ML:

- Bias & Data Issues
- Overfitting / Underfitting
- Lack of Causal Understanding
- Interpretability Challenges
- High Resource Demands

#### Model Evaluation & Improvement:

- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, MSE
- Techniques: Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, regularization, cross-validation, ensemble methods

# Personal thoughts
This section will be used by me in parts of this journey. I will try to put down my own thoughts and how I feel about the content I learned (or tried to learn).

In this unit, I did not learn much due to two reasons:

First, I already have basic knowledge about AI and its usage in general, and secondly, the advanced keywords feel overwhelming so my brain just shut off when I tried to learn those parts.

Hence I decided to feel satisfied that I at least learned the difference between supervised and non-supervised learning and the fact that many algorithms exists in AI.

Going forward, I hope to get a deeper knowledge about AI, so in a part, I'm exicted, but also worried about the math part. I'll let future me (hopefully soon) deal with such issues.
