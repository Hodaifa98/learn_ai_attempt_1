# Machine Learning Types, Tasks, and Data Analysis Methods

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning the input comes with the correct output.

**Common tasks:**
- **Classification**: Predict categorical outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam)
- **Regression**: Predict continuous outcomes (e.g., house prices)

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and attempts to find hidden patterns or structures.

**Common tasks:**
- **Clustering**: Group similar items (e.g., customer segmentation)
- **Association Rule Mining**: Discover relationships between variables (e.g., market basket analysis)

### 3. Semi-supervised Learning
Uses a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data, combining the strengths of supervised and unsupervised learning.

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
A type of learning where an agent interacts with an environment and learns through rewards and punishments. Often used in robotics and game AI.

## Learning Approaches

### Instance-Based Learning
Learns by comparing new problem instances with examples seen in training. No general model is built ahead of time.

**Example:** k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

### Model-Based Learning
Builds a general model during training, which is then used to make predictions.

**Examples:** Linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

## Types of ML-Based Data Analysis Tasks

- **Classification**: Assign items to predefined categories
- **Clustering**: Group data points into clusters based on similarity
- **Prediction**: Estimate future outcomes based on current data
- **Regression**: Predict numerical values
- **Association Rule Mining**: Find rules that describe large portions of data (e.g., "If A, then B")

## Procedures for ML-Based Data Analysis

1. **Define the problem** (classification, regression, etc.)
2. **Collect and preprocess data** (cleaning, normalization, etc.)
3. **Choose the right algorithm** based on problem type and data
4. **Split data into training and test sets**
5. **Train the model** on training data
6. **Evaluate the model** on test data
7. **Tune hyperparameters** for better performance
8. **Deploy and monitor** the model in production
