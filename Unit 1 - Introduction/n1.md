## Introduction:

#### Definition
Artificial Intellegence (AI) can be defined in several ways. Acting rationally is the most adopted approach.

#### Weak vs Strong AI
Weak AI is designed for specific tasks (chess, classifying spam...) while strong AI refer to general intellegence with human-level flexibilty (not yet achieved).

#### Historical context
- 1956, Dartmouth Conference – Term "Artificial Intelligence" coined.
- Early AI: symbolic systems, logic, and rule-based reasoning.
- 1970s–80s: Expert systems (if-then rules) dominated.
- 1990s onward: Statistical AI → rise of machine learning.
- 2010s–Now: Deep learning, large models (GPT, DALL·E, AlphaGo, etc.)

#### Objectives of AI:
AI is not just pattern recognition, it tries to solve a wide array of problems:
- Perception – Vision, speech, sensory input
- Reasoning – Deduction, planning, problem-solving
- Learning – From data (ML), from interaction (RL)
- Natural Language – Understanding/generation (NLP)
- Action – Robotics, games, autonomous systems
- Social/Emotional Intelligence – Empathy, collaboration (early research)

#### What Makes a System “Intelligent”?
- An intelligent agent must:
- Sense its environment
- Reason about possible actions
- Act to achieve its goals
- Learn and adapt over time

## Requirements for AI

#### Data
It's the fuel of AI (especially machine learning). Data need to have both quality and quantity, more quality is better but both are important.
Supervised learning need labeled data, while unsupervised or self-supervised models need raw/unlabeled data.

#### Computational Power
- Traditional AI (search, logic) = CPU-bound
- Modern AI (deep learning) = GPU/TPU-bound (parallel processing)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, JAX, etc.

#### Algorithms & Models
From classical AI (search, inference) to statistical learning (linear regression, SVMs) to deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).

#### Domain knowledge
AI is often applied to something (medicine, finance, robotics). Understanding the context improves performance and interpretation.

## Limitations of AI
1. **Data bias:** AL learning form what it's fed, if it's biased, the output will be biased too.
1. **Generalization Problems:** Many models overfit to training data and fail in real-world scenarios.
1. **Lack of casual reasoning:** Most ML models are correlational, not causal (e.g., deep nets don’t understand cause-effect).
1. **Explainability:** Especially in deep learning, models can become black boxes.
1. **Robustness & safety:** Small changes in input (adversarial attacks) can lead to big misbehaviors. <br>AI doesn't "know" when it's wrong.
1. **Resource intensive:** Training large models (e.g., GPT-4) requires massive data, energy and compute.

## Types of AI
#### AI Types by Capability (currently only ANI exists)

| Type                  | Description                              | Example                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Narrow AI (ANI)       | Can do one task well                     | Siri, spam filter, AlphaGo                   |
| General AI (AGI)      | Human-like thinking and flexibility      | None yet (still theoretical)                 |
| Superintelligent AI   | Exceeds human intelligence in all domains| Hypothetical (discussion stage)              |
